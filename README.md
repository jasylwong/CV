I am a proactive and dynamic **Full Stack Junior Developer** (in training), looking for my first role in the tech industry. I am currently enrolled in the software development programme at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), one of the most discerning dev bootcamps in the world.

At the end of 2018, I qualified as an actuary. This represents a globally recognised profession and internationally recognised qualification that is renowned for being particularly arduous and with a signicantly high drop out rate. With that under my belt, I am
now looking for my next challenge - somewhere I can put my driven nature, analytical mind and creative side to use.

What attracts me to Software Development is the opportunity to pursue a modern analytical role in a technical and computing environment. Whilst I have always been mathematically inclined, I look forward to exercising my enjoyment of problem solving in an innovative and technology driven atmostphere.

**Tech skills:** Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
